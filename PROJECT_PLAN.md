# Stock Sentiment Analyzer - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A visual web application that analyzes stock sentiment from social media and news sources to identify potential buying opportunities.

## Business Objectives
- Scan Reddit, Twitter/X, and news sites for stock mentions
- Analyze sentiment using VADER (upgradeable to FinBERT later)
- Track real-time and historical stock prices (1d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m)
- Detect pump phases (early, mid, late, post)
- Visual dashboard with color-coded signals (green/yellow/red)
- Target: 5-10% gains by identifying pumps early

## Project Status: PLANNING PHASE
**Current Phase**: Architecture & API design
**Next Phase**: MVP Development
**Project Manager**: Active coordination of Architecture, API Integration, and UI Components specialists

---

## Development Phases
*Will be defined after specialist analysis*

### Phase 1: MVP Core (TBD)
- Backend data collection
- Basic sentiment analysis
- Database storage
- Simple dashboard

### Phase 2: Visualization (TBD)
- Price charts
- Sentiment indicators
- Color-coded signals

### Phase 3: Real-time Features (TBD)
- Live updates
- Notifications
- Pump phase detection

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (TBD)
- Historical analysis
- Portfolio tracking
- Advanced FinBERT integration

## Quality Gates (Per Coordination Protocol)

### Before Marking Features Complete
- [ ] Functionality tested with real data
- [ ] Edge cases identified and handled
- [ ] Integration points verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] User confirmation obtained
- [ ] Build process verified

### Feature Development Methodology
1. Build features one by one
2. Complete and test each feature 100% before moving to next
3. User validation required for each major feature
4. Commit after user confirms feature works
5. Maintain proper build structure throughout

---

## Risk Assessment
*Pending specialist analysis*

### Identified Risks
- TBD: API rate limiting constraints
- TBD: Data accuracy and reliability
- TBD: Sentiment analysis accuracy
- TBD: Real-time data costs
- TBD: Scalability limitations

### Mitigation Strategies
- TBD: Based on specialist recommendations

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Data collection latency < 5 seconds
- Sentiment analysis processing < 1 second per mention
- Dashboard load time < 2 seconds
- API error rate < 1%

### Business Metrics
- Accurately identify pumps in early phase (user validation)
- Minimize false positives (red signals that were actually opportunities)
- User achieves 5-10% gain targets (requires real-world testing)

## Next Steps

1. **Architecture Specialist**: Design system architecture
2. **API Integration Specialist**: Evaluate and recommend APIs
3. **UI Components Specialist**: Design dashboard and visualizations
4. **Project Manager**: Synthesize recommendations into final plan
5. **User Approval**: Present comprehensive plan for validation
6. **Development Kickoff**: Begin Phase 1 implementation
