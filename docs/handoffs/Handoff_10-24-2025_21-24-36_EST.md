# Session Handoff - 10/24/2025 21:24:36 EST

## Session Focus
Investigate Finnhub API failure, research Twitter sentiment alternatives, remove Finnhub from codebase, and prepare for future Twitter integration when app becomes profitable.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Finnhub Social Sentiment Requires Paid Tier (DISCOVERED)
- **Issue**: Free Finnhub API key returns 403 "You don't have access to this resource" for social sentiment endpoint
- **Element/Component**: Finnhub social sentiment API endpoint
- **Impact**: Cannot get Twitter + Reddit aggregated data on free tier
- **Root Cause**: Social sentiment endpoint is NOT actually available on free tier despite documentation suggesting otherwise
- **User Feedback**: "i don't want just reddit though, I want x - is that what finnhub is for?"

### 2. Data Sources Section Not Appearing for Users
- **Issue**: User cannot see the new "Data Sources" breakdown section
- **Element/Component**: StockDetail modal multi-source section
- **Impact**: User doesn't know multi-source sentiment was implemented
- **Root Cause**: Testing with obscure stocks (ADUR) that have no news articles + Reddit rate limiting = no data to display
- **User Feedback**: "I don't see this - Data Sources section"

### 3. Reddit Rate Limiting on Every Page Interaction
- **Issue**: Reddit API gets hit on every Top 3 load, every stock click, every page refresh
- **Element/Component**: Reddit service caching strategy
- **Impact**: Quickly hits 60 req/min limit, causes "Top 3 Most Talked About" to disappear and empty sentiment data
- **User Request**: "we need to cache the reddit posts so it doesn't try to pull from it everytime"
- **Status**: **UNRESOLVED** - High priority for next session

### 4. Top 3 Duplicates and Wrong Count (From Session 3)
- **Issue**: Same stock appearing twice, only 2 stocks showing instead of 3
- **Status**: **UNRESOLVED** - Still needs debugging

### 5. BYND Sentiment Inaccurate (From Session 3)
- **Issue**: BYND showing positive sentiment when should be negative (failed short squeeze)
- **Status**: **UNRESOLVED** - Need to verify multi-source aggregation logic

### 6. Top 3 Stocks Not Clickable (From Session 3)
- **Issue**: Cannot click Top 3 stocks to view detailed analysis
- **Status**: **UNRESOLVED** - Need onClick handler

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Finnhub, Adjusted Sentiment Weights ‚úÖ
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed all Finnhub service imports and code from sentiment aggregator
  - Changed sentiment weights:
    - **Alpha Vantage**: 40% (up from 30%) - News with AI sentiment
    - **Reddit**: 60% (up from 35%) - Weighted subreddit scoring
    - **Twitter**: 0% (placeholder for future, down from 35%)
  - Updated TypeScript interfaces to use `twitter` instead of `finnhub`
  - Updated frontend StockDetail to display "Twitter/X Sentiment" (ready for future)
  - Added comprehensive TODO comments explaining future Twitter integration options
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/src/services/sentiment-aggregator.service.ts` - Removed Finnhub, adjusted weights, added TODO comments
  - `frontend/src/components/StockDetail.tsx` - Changed "Finnhub" to "Twitter/X Sentiment"
  - `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Updated TypeScript interfaces
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **Success** - Code compiles, ready for testing

### 2. Researched Twitter Sentiment Alternatives ‚úÖ
- **Research Findings**:
  - **EODHD Tweets Sentiment API**: Aggregated Twitter sentiment by ticker, likely cheaper than Finnhub, free tier available for other endpoints
  - **TwitterAPI.io**: $0.15 per 1,000 tweets (100k tweets = $15), requires scraping + running own sentiment analysis
  - **Finnhub Paid Tier**: Social sentiment available but price unknown (need to contact sales)
  - **Direct Twitter API**: Minimum $100/month, too expensive
- **Decision**: Wait until app is profitable, then likely use EODHD or TwitterAPI.io
- **User Feedback**: "if i start making money I wanna invest in it" and "100k tweets is insane dude" (about TwitterAPI.io - too much data)
- **Result**: ‚úÖ **Research complete**, clear path forward documented in code

---

## What Works Now

### ‚úÖ Two-Source Sentiment Aggregation (Ready to Test)
- Alpha Vantage (40%) + Reddit (60%)
- Finnhub errors eliminated
- Frontend UI ready to display Twitter when added
- TODO comments guide future implementation

### ‚úÖ Clear Upgrade Path for Twitter
- EODHD or TwitterAPI.io identified as affordable options
- Code structure ready to add Twitter source
- Weights documented for 3-source setup (30% / 30% / 40%)

---

## What Still Doesn't Work

### ‚ùå Reddit Rate Limiting Causing Data Loss (HIGH PRIORITY)

**The Problem:**
Reddit API gets hammered on every user interaction:
- Top 3 section loads ‚Üí hits all 13 subreddits
- User clicks stock card ‚Üí fetches Reddit data
- User opens StockDetail modal ‚Üí fetches Reddit data again
- Page refresh ‚Üí all of the above repeats

With 60 req/min limit, this quickly causes:
- Top 3 section to disappear (no data)
- Empty sentiment for stocks
- "Rate limited" errors flooding logs

**User's Idea:**
"add a button to refresh each ticker instead of the whole page cuz it's pulling from reddit every refresh killing our ability to grab data from it"

**Better Solutions for Next Session:**
1. **Increase backend cache TTL**: 15min ‚Üí 1-2 hours (Reddit posts don't change fast)
2. **Add manual refresh per ticker**: Button to refresh individual stock data
3. **Frontend caching**: Don't refetch when reopening same stock modal
4. **Lazy load Top 3**: Only fetch when user explicitly clicks "Refresh Top 3"
5. **Batch Reddit requests**: Fetch once, cache longer, serve to all components

**Why This Matters:**
Without fixing this, the app is unusable for testing because Reddit data disappears constantly.

### ‚ùå Multi-Source Sentiment Not Visually Verified

**Why Not Tested:**
- User tested with obscure stocks (ADUR, BYND) that have little/no news coverage
- Reddit rate limited = no Reddit data
- Alpha Vantage found no articles for small stocks
- Result: No data to display in "Data Sources" section

**What User Should Do Next Session:**
Test with major stocks: **NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT**
These will have:
- ‚úÖ Lots of Alpha Vantage news articles
- ‚úÖ Reddit discussions (if not rate limited)
- ‚úÖ "Data Sources" section should appear

### ‚ùå Other Bugs from Session 3 (Still Pending)
1. Top 3 duplicates and wrong count
2. BYND sentiment showing positive when should be negative
3. Top 3 stocks not clickable

---

## Code Changes This Session

### Modified Files

1. **`backend/src/services/sentiment-aggregator.service.ts`** (Major changes)
   - **Removed**: All Finnhub imports and code
   - **Changed Weights**:
     ```typescript
     // Before
     finnhub: 0.35, alphaVantage: 0.30, reddit: 0.35

     // After
     twitter: 0.0, alphaVantage: 0.40, reddit: 0.60
     ```
   - **Added TODO Comments**: Lines 8-11, 65-66, 92-94, 141-162
   - **Removed Method**: `fetchFinnhubSentiment()`
   - **Added Placeholder**: `fetchTwitterSentiment()` with implementation example for EODHD

2. **`frontend/src/components/StockDetail.tsx`** (Lines 224-245)
   - **Changed**: `sentiment.sources.finnhub` ‚Üí `sentiment.sources.twitter`
   - **Updated Label**: "Finnhub (Reddit + Twitter)" ‚Üí "Twitter/X Sentiment"
   - **Purpose**: Ready for when Twitter data is added

3. **`frontend/src/services/api.ts`** (Lines 42-47)
   - **Changed Interface**: `finnhub?` ‚Üí `twitter?`
   - **Purpose**: TypeScript types match backend

## Next Session Tasks

### High Priority

1. **Implement Better Reddit Caching Strategy** üî¥ **CRITICAL**
   - Increase cache TTL from 15min to 1-2 hours
   - Add per-ticker manual refresh button
   - Implement frontend caching (don't refetch same stock)
   - Make Top 3 lazy-load (only fetch on explicit refresh)
   - **Goal**: Stop hitting Reddit rate limit on normal usage

2. **Test Multi-Source Sentiment with Major Stocks** üü°
   - Try NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT (stocks with lots of news)
   - Verify "Data Sources" section appears
   - Confirm Alpha Vantage (40%) and Reddit (60%) both show
   - Check weighted aggregation makes sense

3. **Debug Top 3 Duplicates and Count** üü°
   - Check `/api/stocks/top-today` endpoint logic
   - Verify unique tickers
   - Fix count (should be 3, not 2)

4. **Make Top 3 Stocks Clickable** üü°
   - Add onClick handler
   - Open StockDetail modal
   - Should work like watchlist cards

5. **Investigate BYND Sentiment Accuracy** üü°
   - Get raw scores from Alpha Vantage and Reddit
   - Trace through aggregation math manually
   - Verify normalization from -1 to 1 scale
   - Check if news is capturing "failed short squeeze"

### Medium Priority

6. **Research EODHD Pricing**
   - Check if EODHD Tweets Sentiment is more affordable than Finnhub
   - Document exact pricing for future reference

### Low Priority

7. **Create TrackedUsers Frontend Component**
   - Display top performing tracked users
   - Show accuracy rates and ROI
   - List recent picks

---

## Important Code Locations

### Sentiment Weights Configuration
- **File**: `backend/src/services/sentiment-aggregator.service.ts:70-74`
- **Current Weights**: Alpha Vantage 40%, Reddit 60%, Twitter 0%
- **Future Weights**: Alpha Vantage 30%, Reddit 30%, Twitter 40% (documented in comments)

### Twitter Sentiment Placeholder
- **File**: `backend/src/services/sentiment-aggregator.service.ts:141-162`
- **Contains**: Example EODHD implementation in comments
- **Ready**: Just uncomment and add EODHD_API_KEY to .env when profitable

### Reddit Caching (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)
- **File**: `backend/src/services/reddit.service.ts`
- **Current TTL**: 15 minutes (line where cache is initialized)
- **Problem**: Too aggressive, causes rate limiting
- **Fix**: Increase to 1-2 hours minimum

### Frontend Data Sources Display
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/StockDetail.tsx:217-292`
- **Shows**: Twitter (if available), Alpha Vantage, Reddit breakdown
- **Note**: Only displays if `sentiment.sources` exists and has data

---

## Research Summary: Twitter Sentiment APIs

### Option 1: EODHD Tweets Sentiment API üåü **Recommended**
- **What**: Pre-aggregated Twitter sentiment by ticker (like Finnhub)
- **Pricing**: Likely cheaper than Finnhub (need to verify)
- **Free Tier**: Available for some endpoints
- **Pros**: No scraping, no sentiment analysis needed, already aggregated
- **Cons**: Pricing not confirmed yet
- **URL**: https://eodhd.com/financial-apis-blog/tweets-sentiment-api

### Option 2: TwitterAPI.io
- **What**: Raw Twitter data access
- **Pricing**: $0.15 per 1,000 tweets (100k tweets = $15)
- **Pros**: Very affordable, full control over data
- **Cons**: Must scrape tweets yourself, must run sentiment analysis (VADER or OpenAI), more work
- **User Feedback**: "i don't wanna scrape twitter myself lol. 100k tweets is insane dude"
- **Verdict**: Not recommended due to extra work required

### Option 3: Finnhub Paid Tier
- **What**: Social sentiment endpoint (Reddit + Twitter aggregated)
- **Pricing**: Unknown - need to contact sales
- **Pros**: Already familiar with API structure
- **Cons**: Likely more expensive than EODHD, price opacity

### Option 4: Direct Twitter/X API
- **Pricing**: Minimum $100/month
- **Verdict**: ‚ùå Too expensive for this project

### Recommendation for When Profitable
**Use EODHD Tweets Sentiment API**
- Research exact pricing next session
- If affordable, add to .env and uncomment Twitter code
- Adjust weights to 30% / 30% / 40% (Alpha Vantage / Reddit / Twitter)

## User Feedback This Session

### Direct Quotes

1. **On missing Twitter data**:
   - "i don't want just reddit though, I want x - is that what finnhub is for?"
   - **Response**: Yes, Finnhub social sentiment is for Twitter + Reddit, but it's paid only

2. **On Data Sources not appearing**:
   - "I don't see this - Data Sources section"
   - **Reason**: Testing with stocks that have no news + Reddit rate limited

3. **On investment in Twitter data**:
   - "sre lets try that but if i start making money I wanna invest in it"
   - **Decision**: Removed Finnhub, will add Twitter when profitable

4. **On TwitterAPI.io pricing**:
   - "$15 for 100k tweets right?"
   - **Confirmed**: Yes, $0.15 per 1,000 tweets

5. **On scraping Twitter**:
   - "i don't wanna scrape twitter myself lol. 100k tweets is insane dude"
   - **Decision**: Use pre-aggregated API (EODHD) instead of raw scraping

6. **On algorithm accuracy**:
   - "finnhub is gone, but the algo isn't right yet, we will refine it"
   - **Acknowledged**: Multi-source weights and BYND sentiment need testing/refinement

7. **On Reddit rate limiting** (CRITICAL):
   - "we need to cache the reddit posts so it doesn't try to pull from it everytime"
   - "the picks should only update when I manually refresh them"
   - "maybe add a button to refresh each ticker instead of the whole page cuz it's pulling from reddit every refresh killing our ability to grab data from it"
   - "does that make sense? or let me know if you have a better idea, im open to all"
   - **Decision**: HIGH PRIORITY for next session - implement better caching strategy

## Critical Notes for Next Session

### 1. Reddit Caching is Now Top Priority ‚ö†Ô∏è
User explicitly requested better caching because Reddit rate limiting is making the app unusable. Every page interaction hits Reddit API, quickly exceeding 60 req/min limit.

**Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. Increase cache TTL to 1-2 hours (from 15 minutes)
2. Add manual refresh buttons (per ticker AND for Top 3 section)
3. Implement frontend caching to avoid refetching same data
4. Make Top 3 lazy-load instead of auto-fetching

**Why Critical:**
Without this fix, user cannot test multi-source sentiment or any other features because data constantly disappears due to rate limiting.

### 2. Multi-Source Sentiment Ready But Untested
All code changes complete and compiled successfully:
- Finnhub removed ‚úÖ
- Weights adjusted (40% Alpha Vantage, 60% Reddit) ‚úÖ
- Frontend UI updated ‚úÖ
- Twitter placeholder ready ‚úÖ

**But user hasn't seen it work yet** because:
- Tested with obscure stocks (no news articles)
- Reddit rate limited (no Reddit data)
- "Data Sources" section only appears when sources have data

**Next session must:**
- Test with major stocks (NVDA, AAPL, TSLA)
- Verify "Data Sources" section appears
- Confirm weights and aggregation are working correctly

### 3. Algorithm Refinement Needed
User acknowledged: "the algo isn't right yet, we will refine it"

This means:
- BYND sentiment showing positive when should be negative = wrong
- Sentiment weights may need adjustment after testing
- Pump detection logic may need tuning
- Don't assume current implementation is final

### 4. Twitter Integration Path Clear
When app becomes profitable:
1. Sign up for EODHD Tweets Sentiment API (research pricing first)
2. Add `EODHD_API_KEY` to `.env`
3. Uncomment Twitter code in sentiment-aggregator.service.ts:141-162
4. Adjust weights to 30% / 30% / 40% (Alpha Vantage / Reddit / Twitter)
5. Test and verify

### 5. Prioritize User Experience Over Feature Addition
User needs:
- Stable app that doesn't lose data
- Ability to test features without constant rate limiting
- Manual control over when data refreshes

**Don't add new features until caching is fixed.**

---

**Status**: Finnhub removed, weights adjusted, Twitter path documented, Reddit caching identified as critical blocker
**Next Milestone**: Fix Reddit caching, test multi-source sentiment, then refine algorithm
**Blocker**: Reddit rate limiting makes app hard to use - fix this FIRST
**Recommendation**: Session 5 should focus exclusively on caching improvements before any new features
