# Session Handoff - 10/24/2025 12:38:29 EST

## Session Focus
Feature development session: Implemented penny stock weighting system, market cap classification, low capital suitability analysis, and "Top 3 Most Talked About Today" trending section. Also established end session protocol for future sessions.

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. Lack of Penny Stock Prioritization
- **Issue**: Original implementation treated all subreddits equally, missing opportunities in penny stock communities
- **Impact**: Low capital traders couldn't easily find affordable stocks with pump potential
- **Context**: User has limited capital and wants 5-10% gains on affordable stocks

### 2. No Market Cap Visibility
- **Issue**: Users couldn't tell if a stock was suitable for low capital accounts
- **Impact**: Wasted time analyzing expensive stocks or extremely risky nano caps
- **Need**: Clear indication of stock affordability and risk level

### 3. No Daily Trending Visibility
- **Issue**: Users had to manually add tickers to watchlist to discover what's trending
- **Impact**: Missed trending opportunities that could be profitable
- **Need**: Automatic discovery of most talked about stocks today

### 4. No Session Continuity Protocol
- **Issue**: No standardized way to document sessions and hand off work
- **Impact**: Lost context between sessions, duplicated work, unclear status
- **Need**: Consistent documentation for session handoffs

- Posts sorted by weighted score, not just upvotes

### ✅ Market Cap Classification
- Stocks classified into 6 tiers (nano/micro/small/mid/large/mega)
- Penny stock detection working
- Low capital suitability analysis functional
- Capital needed calculation accurate
- Risk level assessment appropriate

### ✅ Top 3 Trending Section
- Scans all 13 subreddits automatically
- Calculates weighted scores correctly
- Shows rank badges (#1, #2, #3)
- Displays penny badges when applicable
- Includes full analysis (price, sentiment, pump phase)
- Refresh button works
- Loads on dashboard startup

### ✅ Visual Indicators
- Purple "Penny" badges on stock cards
- Market cap displayed (e.g., "$150M • micro cap")
- Low capital suitability section in details
- ✅ or ⚠️ indicators for suitability
- Capital needed shown for 100 shares

### ✅ Project Documentation

## What Still Doesn't Work

### ❌ Twitter/X Integration
**Status**: Not implemented

**Why It's Not Working**:
- Twitter API has strict rate limits on free tier (500 tweets/month)
- Would deplete quota very quickly with current architecture
- Need to implement strategic usage or find alternative

**Next Steps**:
- Research Twitter API v2 free tier limits
- Consider implementing selective Twitter fetches (only for trending stocks)
- Or postpone until willing to pay for Twitter API

### ❌ Historical Sentiment Tracking
**Status**: Not implemented

**Why It's Not Working**:
- Database not being used (optional PostgreSQL setup)
- No storage of historical sentiment snapshots
- Can't chart sentiment trends over time

**Next Steps**:
- Implement PostgreSQL database setup
- Store daily sentiment snapshots
- Create charts showing sentiment evolution

### ❌ Auto-Refresh for Top 3
**Status**: Manual refresh only

**Why It's Not Working**:
- No auto-refresh timer implemented
- Wanted to ensure rate limits aren't exceeded
- User must click refresh button

**Next Steps**:
- Add 15-minute auto-refresh timer
- Respect Reddit rate limits (~60 req/min)
- Add visual countdown showing next refresh

### ❌ Desktop Notifications
**Status**: Not implemented

**Why It's Not Working**:
- No notification system built
- No signal change detection
- Would require browser permissions

**Next Steps**:
- Implement browser Notification API
- Detect when stock signal changes (green → red, etc.)
- Ask user permission for notifications
