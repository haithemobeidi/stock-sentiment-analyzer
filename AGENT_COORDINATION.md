# Agent Coordination Log - Stock Sentiment Analyzer

## Project Manager Directives

### Executive Decisions Made
1. **Project Structure**: Monorepo at `/home/haith/projects/stock-sentiment-analyzer`
2. **Development Approach**: MVP-first with single stock tracking
3. **API Budget**: Free tier only for MVP phase
4. **Quality Standard**: Feature-by-feature development with user validation

### Coordination Pattern
**Pattern**: Parallel Analysis → Synthesis → Sequential Implementation
**Active Tracks**: 3 parallel analysis tracks
**Status**: Planning phase - gathering specialist input

---

## Track 1: Architecture Specialist

### Agent Handoff Brief
**Context**: New web application project for stock sentiment analysis. User wants to track social media mentions, analyze sentiment, and correlate with stock price movements to identify buying opportunities.

**Requirements**:
1. Design complete system architecture for stock sentiment analyzer
2. Define component breakdown (frontend, backend, data layer)
3. Design data flow from sources → sentiment → aggregation → visualization
4. Create database schema for storing mentions, sentiment scores, price data
5. Plan caching strategy for API data
6. Consider scalability from MVP (1 stock) to multi-stock tracking

**Constraints**:
- Free tier APIs only (Reddit, Twitter, financial data)
- Personal project (solo developer, no team)
- Must handle rate limiting gracefully
- MVP focuses on single stock, but architecture should support expansion
- TypeScript for both frontend and backend

**Success Criteria**:
1. Clear component diagram (text-based ASCII art acceptable)
2. Data flow architecture showing all integration points
3. Database schema with tables and relationships
4. Caching strategy that minimizes API calls
5. Scalability plan from MVP to production

**PM Approval**: Architecture should prioritize simplicity for MVP while maintaining clean patterns for future expansion.

**Cross-Agent Input**: Will be synthesized with API Integration and UI Components specialist recommendations.

**Mandatory**: First read /home/haith/documents/CLAUDE_AGENT_COORDINATION.md and apply the relevant coordination patterns to this task.

## Track 2: API Integration Specialist

### Agent Handoff Brief
**Context**: Stock sentiment analyzer needs to integrate with multiple data sources (Reddit, Twitter/X, financial APIs, news) to collect mentions and price data. All APIs must be free tier for MVP.

**Requirements**:
1. Research and recommend specific APIs for:
   - Reddit data collection (official API vs alternatives)
   - Twitter/X data (free tier limitations)
   - Stock price data (real-time and historical)
   - News aggregation (financial news sources)
2. Document rate limits and free tier constraints for each API
3. Design API client architecture with rate limiting and caching
4. Recommend data refresh intervals based on rate limits
5. Plan error handling and fallback strategies
6. Identify which APIs require authentication and setup process

**Constraints**:
- FREE TIER ONLY for MVP
- Must handle rate limiting gracefully
- Must provide real-time or near-real-time data (within 5-15 minutes acceptable)
- Must include historical price data (1d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m)
- Node.js + TypeScript implementation

**Success Criteria**:
1. Specific API recommendations with justifications
2. Rate limit analysis and refresh interval strategy
3. API client architecture design
4. Authentication/setup requirements documented
5. Cost analysis (free tier limits, when costs would start)

**PM Approval**: Prioritize APIs with generous free tiers and good documentation. If multiple options exist, recommend the most reliable even if slightly less generous on rate limits.

**Cross-Agent Input**: Will inform Architecture Specialist's data flow design and UI Specialist's refresh strategy.

**Mandatory**: First read /home/haith/documents/CLAUDE_AGENT_COORDINATION.md and apply the relevant coordination patterns to this task.

## Track 3: UI Components Specialist

### Agent Handoff Brief
**Context**: Stock sentiment analyzer needs an intuitive visual dashboard that clearly communicates sentiment signals and pump phase detection. Target users are individual investors looking for quick buy/sell signals.

**Requirements**:
1. Design dashboard layout for stock sentiment display
2. Create color-coding system for signals (green/yellow/red with clear meanings)
3. Design stock card component showing:
   - Current price and price changes (1d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m)
   - Sentiment score and trend
   - Pump phase indicator (early/mid/late/post)
   - Social media mention volume
4. Recommend chart library (Chart.js vs Lightweight-Charts vs alternatives)
5. Design real-time update UX (how to show new data arriving)
6. Plan mobile responsiveness strategy

**Constraints**:
- Modern web technologies (Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS)
- Framework choice: Lit vs React (provide recommendation)
- Must be visually clear at a glance (busy investors checking quickly)
- Should handle loading states and API errors gracefully
- MVP shows single stock, but design should scale to multiple stocks

**Success Criteria**:
1. Dashboard layout mockup (text-based wireframe acceptable)
2. Stock card component design with all data points
3. Color-coding system with clear semantic meanings
4. Chart library recommendation with justification
5. UI framework recommendation (Lit vs React) with reasoning
6. Real-time update UX pattern

**PM Approval**: Design should prioritize clarity and speed of information comprehension. This is a tool for quick decisions, not a complex analytics platform.

**Cross-Agent Input**: Will inform Architecture Specialist's component structure and API Specialist's data refresh strategy.

**Mandatory**: First read /home/haith/documents/CLAUDE_AGENT_COORDINATION.md and apply the relevant coordination patterns to this task.

## Synthesis Phase (Post-Specialist Input)

### Project Manager Responsibilities
1. Review all three specialist recommendations
2. Identify conflicts or overlapping concerns
3. Make executive decisions on:
   - Final tech stack
   - Specific API selections
   - UI framework choice
   - Database selection
4. Create comprehensive implementation plan with phases
5. Define agent assignments for each development phase
6. Present final plan to user for approval

### Convergence Criteria
- All specialists have provided their analysis
- No major architectural conflicts between recommendations
- Clear path forward for MVP development
- Realistic timeline estimates for each phase

---

**Status**: Planning phase - coordinating parallel analysis
**Next Action**: Launch three specialist agents
**Expected Completion**: All three tracks complete before synthesis
**Project Manager**: Standing by to synthesize and make final decisions
